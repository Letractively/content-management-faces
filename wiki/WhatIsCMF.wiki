#summary What is Content Management Faces?

= Introduction =

Content Management Faces is meant as a drop in cms solution for jsf2.  The idea is to have a single jar file (cmf.jar) that you can put into the WEB-INF/lib directory of your web application that will provide a jsf tag library to insert various content tags in your pages, and a web interface from which you can edit your content.
